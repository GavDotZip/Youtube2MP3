In this project there are two classes; mp3Player.py and youtubeConversion.py.

Within the youtubeConversion.py file, the user is prompted to input a YouTube URL, from which the audio of the video will be downloaded to a chosen directory.

When using the mp3Player.py file, the user is then prompted to choose which folder they wish to play music from, and are then presented with a GUI. Within this GUI,
thr user can pause, play, stop and unpause the audio file.

For testing purposes I downloaded the audio file from the Ace Attorney music compilation video on YouTube (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBFl-ux9H7g&t=4668s)
